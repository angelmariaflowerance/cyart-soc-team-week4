---

## Query Summary

1. IP Address: 192.168.1.79 → No hits (expected private IP)
2. Hostname: DESKTOP-IROTPGQ → 504 Gateway Timeout (service unavailable)
3. Technique Search (T1078): 2 active campaigns found, including TAG-144 in South America
4. Privilege Escalation Search: Active exploitation confirmed across multiple APT groups

---

## Threat Intelligence Assessment

- T1078 (Valid Accounts) remains highly exploited globally
- Multiple APT groups confirmed using this technique (e.g., TAG-144)
- Internal findings match attack patterns (dangerous SeDebugPrivilege, SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege)
- Suspicious accounts: test_admin (3 events), maria (2 events)
- Events clustered in short timeframes → possible automated tools

Risk Level: HIGH

---

## Recommendations

Immediate (0-24h):
- Disable & investigate test_admin and maria
- Review authentication logs for anomalies
- Enable alerts for Event ID 4672 in Wazuh

Short-term (1-7 days):
- Hunt for related Event IDs (4624, 4625, 4648, 4768, 4769)
- Audit privilege assignments and enforce least privilege
- Baseline normal privilege use for anomaly detection

Long-term (1-3 months):
- Deploy PAM and MFA
- Build Wazuh rules aligned to T1078
- Train SOC team on privilege escalation detection

---

## Conclusion

OTX confirms T1078 is an actively exploited technique. Internal findings align with known APT behaviors. Incident priority is HIGH: accounts must be investigated immediately and monitoring enhanced.
